A tkinter implementation of tetris.

Another project I finished on the computer in my classroom.

## Features

- Follows the tetris guideline, including complete SRS rules, five tetriminoes in the preview queue, and tetrimino holding mechanism.
- Single/double player mode, TSD mode, cheese mode available.

## Bugs

The deboucing algorithm doesn't work on Unix-like systems. This means that DAS doesn't work on those systems.

## Manual

Fiddle around with the flags at the top of the `main.py` file. You'll hopefully find enough comments to guide you.
